## 

In a world of increasing specialization everyone has tasks that they excel at and others that they would prefer to outsource. Whether it's making dinner, walking the dog, or even learning a new language, there are boxes on everyone's to-do list that consistently get checked and others that fall by the wayside. Further, these tasks are not the same for everyone. Person A may make fantastic dinners but struggle to get home to let her dog out during the week. Person B may work a different shift but finds making meals burdensome and a pain. On a budget, hiring outside help may be untenable for both individuals, and they may struggle to get these things done. *Tit-for-tat* targets such inefficiences, however, and allows the members of its community to barter the exchange of services to get the most out of their 24 hours in a day. A willingness to help, is all that is required 

## A middle.

To accomplish this goal, *Tit-for-tat* creates a virtual marketplace where users can either: 1) Exchange their services for the services of others (going *Tit-for-tat*) or 2) "Pay" for the services of others using a type of pseudo-currency or credit system (credits are earned by selling services; new users get a flat number of credits to get started). Users are able to create a profile of their marketable skills and/or the tasks they wish to contribute to the marketplace (e.g. tutoring, car services, lawncare, pet sitting, etc.), the times and locations they are available to help, the tasks they need help with, the times and locations where they need help, and (optionally) the number of credits they are charging for their services.

*Tit-for-tat* utilizes a unique matching algorithm that connects users based upon the services they need versus the services they are providing, their availability versus the times they need help, feedback from prior clients, and whether they are looking to “buy” services (and what they are willing to pay) or whether they are looking to go *Tit-for-tat*. Users are also presented with suggestions for services that are similar to what they are already offering/looking for (and that they may not have thought to include in their profile). The more that a user uses our product, the better the ratings are that (s)he receives from past clients, and the more reliable the user is for giving feedback on past bartering partners, the more likely it is that her/his services are to be seen by new/other users.

## An end.

*Tit-for-tat* hopes to revolutionize the way that people do their chores. It allows users to multi-task like never before and to swap out the tasks they dislike for more enjoyable ones. Further, it allows users to commoditize their free time and to acquire services that had previously been outside of their price range. Our biggest concerns, at present, are how to police unfulfilled agreements, protect the privacy of our users, and monetize our product while staying true to the quid pro quo model. We would like to offer the ability to purchase services at a reduced cost (e.g. when users lack the bartering credits to acquire a service); however, we need to be careful that this does not become the majority of our transactions in order to stay true to our business model. As we move forward in the MIDS curriculum, we fully expect to refine our matching algorithms and to continue to get better at helping our neighbors scratch eachother’s backs!
