This portfolio consists of two ideas for data science projects that I came up with for the w201 course, in the MIDS program, at UC-Berkeley. The first project, Tinker, is an app that analyzes data collected from sensors on a golfer’s body to deliver actionable swing changes that the golfer can make to improve his or her power, accuracy, and consistency. It aims to revolutionize the way golfers train and to shake up the coaching space. The second idea, Tit-For-Tat, is an online community, based on a barter-economic model, where local individuals are connected based on shared needs for services. The goal is to maximize what we can get done in a day since our free-time is not uniformly distributed. Figure .: Video Presentation for First Big Idea 0.0.1 Abstract of my first cool idea Everyone has things they better at than others, chores they find more enjoyable than others, and days when there just isn’t enough time to take care of all of life’s responsibilities. Getting the help or services we need, when we need them, can be incredibly expensive; however, the alternative to outsourcing some of these tasks is oftentimes just as costly in time and energy spent. Tit For Tat is an online marketplace aimed at solving this dilemma. Our goal is to connect people who need services with people who are able to supply them. The catch? No currency is exchanged between the two parties. To accomplish this, Tit For Tat matches the needs and offered services of Client A with the needs and offered services of Client B. When a match is found, Client A exchanges his/her services on days \\(y_1\\)..\\(y_n\\) with the needs of Client B on days \\(z_1\\)..\\(z_n\\). Free time is maximized for both parties; everyone benefits from the system. Abstract of my second cool idea Every year, millions of amateur golfer spend countless hours tinkering with their swings. Despite all of this tinkering, many of these individuals will spend the majority of their time with little or no knowledge about what they need to fix or how to go about fixing what they have identified as the problem. Professional lessons are expensive, and coaching ceases when the lesson ends. At Tinker, we want to revolutionize the coaching space for the sport of golf. By utilizing strategically placed sensors in the golfer’s wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles (as well as information about the shot’s outcome, tendancies of the golfer, and his/her swing type), we are able to provide a service where golfers of all swing types and skill levels get actionable tips and solutions, whenever they want to play, for a fraction of the cost of traditional lessons. Tinker makes those countless hours practicing start to count; we want to do the tinkering for you. About the author I’m Nick McCormack, and I currently work as a business intelligence analyst at Milwaukee Tool. In a previous life, I was a Ph.D. candidate in cognitive psychology/neuroscience at Ohio State after getting my undergraduate degree in psychology from Marquette University. I have experience working both independently and as part of a team on research and programming projects, with large data sets, and with sensitive information. In my free time, I like spending time with my friends, my family, and my dog, LeBron (who is half-Cavalier). I love playing and following sports, running, and music. A personal goal of mine is to one day work in basketball analytics for an NBA team. Updated: 2017-11-29 "],
["fours-not-fores.html", "1 Tinker 1.1 What is Tinker, and what do we hope to accomplish? 1.2 How do we plan to accomplish this? 1.3 How does this accomplishment transform the golf coaching space?", " 1 Tinker Keywords golf, coaching, wearables, clustering, neural networks 1.1 What is Tinker, and what do we hope to accomplish? Every year millions of amateur golfers spend countless hours tinkering with their stance, grip, backswing, and swing angle in an attempt to lower their scores on the course. Despite all of this tinkering, these individuals, oftentimes, have no idea what it is that they actually need to correct or how to fix what they have correctly identified as the problem. Valuable time is spent fixing and un-fixing what they have changed, and without proper coaching, practice may do more harm than good. Professional lessons are expensive, and further, the coaching received during these lessons ceases when the lesson ends. Our goal at Tinker is to revolutionize the coaching space and provide the same services that expensive golf lessons provide, at a fraction of the cost, whenever the golfer wants to play. 1.2 How do we plan to accomplish this? To do this, Tinker uses strategically placed sensors on a golfer’s wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles (as well as information about the shot’s outcome) to analyze the components of a golfer’s swing and offer actionable adjustments that they can implement to improve their accuracy, power, and consistency. Every round played, every trip to the driving range, becomes a potential data point that can be used to help the golfer get the absolute most out of his or her practice time. Tinker also recognizes that there are multiple ways to get to the same result. Not all successful swings follows the same club path (nor are positive outcomes defined the same way by golfers of different skill levels). By analyzing the locations of our sensor-targeted areas at the swing’s start, midpoint, apex, point of contact, and finish (as well as information about the current golfer’s handicapp, tendancies, and the outcome of the shot), Tinker using clustering algorithms and neural networks to assign the golfer to one of n number of swing prototypes and offers personalized suggestions, drills, and tips that are ranked based on what is most likely to improve the golfer’s scores and align them with their swing prototype. 1.3 How does this accomplishment transform the golf coaching space? At Tinker, we promise to do the tinkering for you. While we would eventually like to revolutionize the way coaching is done in all sports, our current goal is to help all golfers maximize their potential, get the absolute most out of their practice time, and do so at a low cost. Tinker will revolutionize the way players talk about their swings and the ways that they go about improving them. It is hard enough finding the time to practice; at Tinker, we’ll make sure that you don’t waste that time when you actually have it. "],
["tit4tat.html", "2 Tit For Tat: A Barter System For Services 2.1 Why go Tit4Tat 2.2 How it works 2.3 How it changes the game", " 2 Tit For Tat: A Barter System For Services Keywords barter economy, service trading, Quid pro quo, matching algorithms, similarity scores 2.1 Why go Tit4Tat In a world of increasing specialization everyone has tasks that they excel at and tasks that they would prefer to outsource. Whether it is making dinner, walking the dog, or learning a new language, there are boxes on everyone’s to-do list that consistently go unchecked. Further, these tasks are not the same for every person and opportunities to optimize our time and resources often go unrealized. For example, suppose two people live a mile apart. Person A is a fantastic chef who loves to cook and struggles to let her dog out while at work. Person B has plenty of flexibility during the day, but struggles to make healthy dinners over the course of the week. If these individuals are on a budget, they may not be able to afford help with their problems in a pay for service economy. However, if they knew of the other’s situation, a symbiotic agreement could potentially be reached between the two parties. Tit-for-tat aims to correct for such inefficiencies. It strives to identify situations where someone needs help stretching their time and/or budget and aims to connect them with the people who can help. The catch? They have to help them (or someone else) in return. 2.2 How it works To accomplish this goal, Tit-for-tat creates a virtual marketplace where users can either: 1) Exchange their services for the services of others (going Tit-for-tat) or 2) “Pay” for services using credits banked from past services performed. Upon joining the Tit-for-tat community, users complete a detailed questionnaire of their skills, tasks they are willing to contribute (e.g. tutoring, car services, lawncare, pet sitting, etc.), times and locations they are available to help, tasks they need help with, times and locations they need help, and (optionally) the number of credits they are charging for their services (if they intend to explore the latter option outlined above). Tit-for-tat then uses this data (as well as location information) to connect users based upon shared needs, availability, reliability (rated by past service partners), and whether they are looking to “buy” services (and what they are willing to pay) or go Tit-for-tat. Users are also presented with suggestions for services that are similar to what they are already offering/looking for. The more that a user uses the app, the better the ratings are that (s)he receives from past clients, and the more reliable the user is at giving feedback for other community members, the more likely (s)he is to be paired with neighboring Tit-for-tatters. 2.3 How it changes the game Tit-for-tat hopes to revolutionize the way that people do their chores. It allows users to multi-task like never before and to swap out the tasks they dislike for more enjoyable ones. Further, it allows users to commoditize their free time and to acquire services that had previously been outside of their price range. Our biggest concerns, at present, are how to police unfulfilled agreements, protect the privacy of our users, and monetize our product while staying true to the quid pro quo model. We would like to offer the ability to purchase services at a reduced cost (e.g. when users lack the bartering credits to acquire a service); however, we need to be careful that this does not become the majority of our transactions in order to stay true to our business model and keep the spirit of the community alive. As we move forward in the MIDS curriculum, we fully expect to refine our algorithms and continue to get better at helping our neighbors help one another. "]
