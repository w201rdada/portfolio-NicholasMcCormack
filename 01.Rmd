# **Tit For Tat: A Barter System For Services**  {#Scratch-Eachother's-Backs}

## A beginning.

In a world of increasing specialization, everyone has tasks that they excel at, and tasks that they would prefer to outsource. Further, time is a commodity, and even when we are physically capable of doing something, it may be impossible to take care of all our responsibilities in a day. For someone on a budget, hiring outside help may be an untenable option, as well. *Tit-for-tat* targets these individuals and creates a marketplace where individuals are brought together in a mass bartering system. Credits are earned for helping other people take care of their tasks, and these credits can later be exchanged for help with our own.

## A middle.

To accomplish this goal, *Tit-for-tat* users create a profile of their marketable skills and/or tasks they wish to contribute to the marketplace (e.g. tutoring, car services, lawncare, pet sitting, etc.), the times and locations they are available to help, the tasks they need help with, the times and locations where they need help, and (optionally) the number of credits they are charging for their services. Alternatively to “selling” their services, users can look for matches in true *Tit-for-tat* fashion and acquire a service they need for a service they provide (without any credits being exchanged between accounts!).

*Tit-for-tat* utilizes a unique matching algorithm that connects users based upon the services they need versus the services they are providing, their availability versus the times they need help, feedback from prior clients (with higher ratings corresponding to higher match scores), and whether they are looking to “buy” services (and what they are willing to pay) or go *Tit-for-tat*. Users are also presented with suggestions for services they could provide that are similar to what they are already offering (and that they may not have thought to include in their profile). The more that a user uses our product and the better ratings they receive from past clients (and how reliably they rate their bartering partners), the more likely their services are to be seen by new/other users.

## An end.

*Tit-for-tat* revolutionizes the way that people do their chores. It allows users to multi-task like never before and to swap out the tasks they hate for more enjoyable ones. Further, it allows users to commoditize their free time and to acquire services, for free, which had previously been outside of their price range. Our biggest concerns, at present, are how to police unfulfilled agreements, protect the privacy of our users, and monetize our product while staying true to the quid pro quo model. We would like to offer the ability to purchase services at a reduced cost (e.g. when users lack the bartering credits to acquire the services); however, we do not want this to become the majority of our transactions. As we move forward in the MIDS curriculum, we fully expect to refine our matching algorithms and to continue to get better at helping our neighbors scratch eachother’s backs!
