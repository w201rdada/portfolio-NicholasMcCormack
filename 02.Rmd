## What is Tinker and what do we hope to accomplish?

Every year millions of amateur golfers spend countless hours tinkering with their stance, grip, backswing, and swing angle in an attempt to lower their scores on the course. Despite all of this tinkering, these individuals oftentimes have no idea what it is that they actually need to correct or how to fix what they have identified as the problem. Valuable time is spent fixing and un-fixing what they have changed, and without proper coaching, practice may do more harm than good. Professional lessons are expensive and the coaching received during these lessons ceases when the lesson ends.  Our goal at Tinker is to revolutionize the golf coaching space and provide the same services that expensive golf lessons provide at a fraction of the cost, whenever the golfer wants to play.

## How do we plan to accomplish this?

To do this, Tinker uses strategically placed sensors on a golfer's wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles (as well as information about the shot's outcome) to analyze the components of a golfer's swing and offer actionable adjustments that they can implement to improve their accuracy, power, and consistency. Every round played and trip to the driving range, becomes a data point that can be used to help the golfer get the absolute most out of his or her practice time. To keep the cost down for consumers, Tinker offers unlimited swing samples in their monthly subscription.

Tinker also recognizes that there are multiple ways to get to the same result and that not every successful swing follows the same trajectory. By analyzing the locations of our sensor-targeted areas at the swing's start, midpoint, apex, point of contact, and finish (as well as information about the current golfer's handicap, tendencies, and the outcome of the shot), Tinker using clustering algorithms to assign the golfer to one of n number of swing prototypes. This classification allows Tinker to offer personalized suggestions, drills, and tips that are ranked based on what is most likely to improve the golfer's scores.
