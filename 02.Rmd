## A beginning.

Every year millions of amateur golfers spend countless hours tinkering with their stance, grip, backswing, and swing angle. Despite all of this tinkering, it is often the case that the golfer has no idea what it is that they actually need to fix. Lessons are expensive, and coaching ceases when the lesson ends. Hours are spent correcting and un-correcting what we think is wrong, and without proper coaching, practice could do more harm than good. Our goal at Tinker is to revolutionize the coaching space by providing the same services that expensive golf lessons provide, at a fraction of the cost, whenever the golfer wants to play.

## A middle.

Tinker uses strategically placed sensors, as well as information about the golfer’s golf game, to analyze the components of their swing and offer actionable adjustments they can implement to improve their accuracy, power, and consistency. Every round played, every trip to the driving range, is a data point that can be used to help the golfer get the absolute most out of her or his practice time.  

Further, our algorithms recognize that there are multiple ways to get to the same result and that not every successful swing follows the same trajectory (or is defined the same by every golfer). By analyzing the setup, swing path, and current abilities of the user, Tinker classifies their swing type and offers personalized suggestions, drills, and tips that provide the maximum amount of gain depending on where they are in their development as a golfer. 


## An end.

At Tinker, we want to do the tinkering for you. Our goal is to help all golfers maximize their potential and get the absolute most out of their practice time. We want to revolutionize the way players talk about their swings and the ways that they go about improving them. It is hard enough finding the time to practice, Tinker makes sure you don’t waste that time, when you have it.
